# CRM acceptance checklist

Source: IMAN CRM Developer Spec dated 5 October 2026. Target: website repository and `/portal`. External email, SMS and WhatsApp delivery excluded. Native mobile app deferred as specified. A source implementation, a passing unit test and a visible export button are not sufficient evidence of complete live acceptance.

Acceptance for each item: specification fields; workflow transitions and history; validation; database and API authorization; administrator, staff and client visibility as applicable; responsive usability; exports where required; recorded tests and live evidence. Mark blocked browser checks pending.

The first audit listed 37 page/module rows. Items 38–41 make the shared customer, permissions, design and live verification requirements explicit to keep the agreed total of 41 auditable.

## Existing evidence

599 automated checks across 22 suites passed for the existing portal. Production migrations 012 and 013 applied. Transactional live database checks passed for assignment, mutation denial, submit, publish, confirm and revocation; test records rolled back. Administrator dashboard, four reminders and report tables observed live. Browser download attempt and technician/client walkthrough blocked by native credential runtime protection. These results do not establish acceptance of missing modules.

## Implementation order

1. Shared customer history, department roles, teams and configuration.
2. Lead intake, six sales boards, multi-product deals and quotation/BOQ.
3. Atomic Won conversion, configurator and phases 0–5 execution.
4. Supply chain and full finance.
5. Help desk, activity logs, attendance and performance.
6. Reporting, design, PWA and all live acceptance evidence.

## Foundation increment

Migration 014 adds audited teams, department memberships, twelve role definitions and versioned shared categories. Staff capability resolution is limited to the current active account. Customer history uses security-invoker queries so assignment, publication and commercial policies remain enforced. New department permissions do not grant legacy administrator powers. CRM configuration is administrator-only; Customer history is visible to authorized staff and administrators. Leads, deals, stock, HR and finance expansion remain pending.

## Sales intake increment

Migration 015 adds manual and mapped CSV/XLSX intake, contact deduplication, six configurable boards, shared multi-product deals, board membership policies, checked stage transitions, section ownership, activity history, saved filters and CSV exports. Follow-ups use portal reminders; lost deals create dated re-engagement tasks. 676 automated checks across 24 suites, TypeScript and production build passed before release. Board revocation also removes assigned contact and reminder access.

Sales acceptance remains partial. Website/Meta/API intake, routing automation, full quotation/BOQ, proposal negotiation gates and atomic Won conversion remain pending. Proposal, negotiation and Won transitions are blocked until those prerequisites are implemented. Live browser verification remains blocked by the protected browser runtime.
